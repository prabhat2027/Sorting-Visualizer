# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Web)

An interactive web application that visually demonstrates how classic sorting algorithms work using animated bar charts. Built as a learning tool for students, this visualizer allows users to understand sorting algorithms not only through animations but also with integrated theoretical explanations.
